# Introduction-to-Robotics-Coursework
This is a project about the Introduction to Robotics coursework。（Since the time is relatively short, the readme is not very standardized.）
We will show that the car uses the slam algorithm for positioning and mapping and the a* algorithm for path planning.
Currently we only show it in the simulation environment
